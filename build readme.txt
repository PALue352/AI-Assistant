Create build.bat in AI_Assistant/ to automate this for developers (you), run once before final installation:

Usage: Double-click build.bat after all sub-AIs are done, then compile installer.iss with Inno Setup Compiler (0.7 Installation).
End-User Process: Users run AI_Assistant_Installer.exe, which handles Python and dependency installation on their chosen drive (e.g., D:) (0.7 Installation: Offers drive selection).
Action: Added build.bat to AI_Assistant/â€”run it later, not now (0.7 Installation).
